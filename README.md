# uni_SE_workshop
A simple web service for a resturant, its not very pretty and does not integrate payment methods, it simpy assumes you did them. Most of the work has been put into the backend of the system, written in C++, it handles HTTP requests using the sockets library.
Unfortonatly this system only run on windows as it was not a requirement to run on anything else.
